## Things left to complete:

- Ubiquiti logo should have hover and active svgs from figma design.

- There should be a loading bar displayed while pictures and whatnot are still being rendered.

- 'Filter' popup window should be closed when the user clicks outside of it.

- CSS files should be moved to their component's respective folder. (and probably migrated to SASS).

- CSS is currently a mix between px and rem. It is better to stick to a single form of measurement.
