## Getting Started

Clone this repo and install dependencies in both the client and server folder SEPERATELY using:

```bash
npm i
```

Once dependencies finish installing, be sure to run both the backend server and frontend dev server SEPERATELY by running the following command in both folders:

```bash
npm start
```

## Testing

Test files for components can be found in their respective folders within src/components, and can be run in client folder using:

```bash
npm t
```

There is also a test file in the server folder that can be run using the same command, but in the server directory instead of client directory.<br/>NOTE: The server must be terminated before you run the tests, or you'll get a big fat error.

A list of 'todos' can be found in the todo.md file for those wishing to continue this project.
